11144: Cluster level overview of workloads deployed, based on prometheus metrics exposed by kubelet, node-exporter, nginx ingress controller
The Kubernetes Cluster (k8s 1.16) dashboard uses the prometheus data source to create a Grafana dashboard with the graph and table panels.

13838: The data used in the dashboard come from the components below, assuming no relabelling were done on them. If you don’t have some of them installed, or if you have configured relabeling on them, you might have to tune the dashboard to your own need.

kube-state-metrics
node-exporter
kube-apiserver
kubelet
kubelet/cadvisor
ETCD
Yes, this dashboard uses quite a few data sources. But these are all common components that you should be monitoring already.


15175: Monitors the Kubernetes cluster and its pods, CPU, Memory, IO, containers and certificate.


15141: Dashboard for showing logs from Kubernetes in Loki. Has filters for namespace, container and stream.

Includes a free text search field, to do string matching of logs in Loki

159: Show classical system metrics of your servers. It’s also linked alerts of the selected servers (if alert are set). Need to use tag name for servers. The tag used is “alias” but you can change it in templating.


11000:The Kubernetess Cluster Overview dashboard uses the prometheus data source to create a Grafana dashboard with the graph, singlestat and table panels.

18267 : Added temperature and fan sensors panels and also small esthetic tweaks:
Changed Overall average to a line every 1m, useful for alerts
Changed Internet traffic bar from 1h to 5m
Changed line thickness from 2 to 1
Changed thresholds from 80 to 90
Added temperature and fan sensors panels, useful for alerts as well

22145: The Loki Logs dashboard uses the data source to create a Grafana dashboard with the panel.
